# Data Challenges

## 1. About Data Challenges

Data alone, without context, is worthless. In fact, on its surface, data is simply a collection of numbers, words, images, vectors, etc. It is only when data is presented with a context that it becomes meaningful and - with the proper context - decisions can be made based on the data but also based on what the data means. Our analyses have shown that the context around the data determines data pricing and packaging. Data is useful depending on who the end consumer is and what they need the data for.

The Ocean Data Challenge program is designed to help data owners discover various contexts for their data; build a community around the data and then turn ideas into commercialisable reality.
